## Sypnosis

I am an analyst in a public policy consulting group, hired by a congresswoman from New York. She's considering gathering a collection of representatives from the northeast to promote legislation to help first-time home buyers in New York and New England. My boss wants to deliver ideas that are grounded in real data, so he had asked me to extract, filter, and clean the government's home mortgage data from 2018, obtained from https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-publication/snapshot-national-loan-level-dataset, preparing it for analysis.

I have been tasks to do the following:

- Determine or estimate, if possible, which subset of the dataset is first-time home buyers in New York and New England, and whether that subset is large enough for analysis.
- Identify aspects of the whole dataset that are relevant for the legislators as they brainstorm ideas for relevant legislation.
- Recommend next steps for the consulting firm based on my analysis.
